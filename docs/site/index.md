## Introduction

Kotbase pairs [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/) with [Couchbase Lite](
https://www.couchbase.com/products/lite/), an embedded NoSQL JSON document database. Couchbase Lite can be used as a
standalone client database, or paired with [Couchbase Server](https://www.couchbase.com/products/server/) and [Sync
Gateway](https://www.couchbase.com/products/sync-gateway/) or [Capella App Services](
https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella/app-services/) for cloud to edge data synchronization. Features include:

* [SQL++](https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql/), key/value, and full-text search queries
* Observable queries, documents, databases, and replicators
* Binary document attachments (blobs)
* Peer-to-peer and cloud-to-edge data sync

Kotbase provides full Enterprise and Community Edition API support for Android and JVM, native iOS and macOS, and
experimental support for available APIs in native Linux and Windows.
